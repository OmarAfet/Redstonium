# Redstonium

A Minecraft launcher built with Rust and [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui).

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- A local clone of the [Zed repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) placed in the project root as `zed/`

## Setup

This project depends on crates from the Zed editor source, referenced as local path dependencies in `Cargo.toml`. You'll need to clone the Zed repository into the project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zed-industries/zed.git zed
```
